Installation

PIP
===
The easiest way to install the Django DColumns package is with pip::

  $ pip install django-dcolumns

GitHub
======
You can also install the GitHub version which has a lot of example code. This
is also useful if you want to see Django DColumns running in a real
environment::

  $ git clone https://github.com/cnobile2012/dcolumn.git

.. note::

  Be aware that the pip requirements in the GitHub repository are not frozen.
  This may cause Django DColumns to break if dependencies are used that are
  much newer than what I used in this release. If this happens, please put a
  issue in my :issues:`GitHub Issues <>` account to let me know.

  It is highly recommended that after doing a pip install to clone the git
  repository. Many examples exist there that will not be in a pip install.
  Examples of how to use CSS with the template tags and a demo PostgreSQL
  database containing test data is also available. The repository can be
  found at :base:`GitHub Code <>`
